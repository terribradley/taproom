* I want to have kegs color coded to show me at a glance if they are cheap or expensive - say greater or less than $5 per pint. I also want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
* I want to look at the kegs that have been consumed.
* Add ability to add keg
